# Introduction
In today's online world, it can sometimes be difficult to discern whether the news you're reading is likely true or not. What if you had a model that could tell you if that article you think is real is actually **fake news?** <br/>In this tutorial, we'll be building a text **classification** model using the Naive Bayes classifier. By the end, you'll have your very own machine learning model trained on a vast dataset to recognize when news might not be authentic. Let's dive in!
## Intuition
In this section, let's cover what a **classifier** is, what **Naive Bayes** is, and some of the assumptions we'll be making in order to build this project. <br/>
### Classification
In machine learning, classification algorithms
