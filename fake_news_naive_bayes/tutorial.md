# Introduction
In today's online world, it can sometimes be difficult to discern whether the news you're reading is likely true or not. What if you had a model that could tell you if that article you think is real is actually **fake news?** <br/>In this tutorial, we'll be building a text **classification** model using the Naive Bayes classifier. By the end, you'll have your very own machine learning model trained on a vast dataset to recognize when news might not be authentic. Let's dive in!
## Intuition
In this section, let's cover what a **classifier** is, what **Naive Bayes** is, and some of the assumptions we'll be making in order to build this project. <br/>
### Classification
In machine learning, classification refer to a type of predictive modeling where the model attempts to predict the labels for a set of input data. The simplest example of this is spam filtering in your email inbox. An algorithm sorts incoming email by analyzing their text (something we're going to get into in just a bit) and decides whether or not to put it in your inbox or your junk.
