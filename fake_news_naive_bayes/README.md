# My Naive Bayes Classifier
<a href = https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset/>Dataset Source</a>
I made my first Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier using this data to determine whether or not the text 
of a news article can be trusted as fact or not. The model weighs the probability of belonging to either category using assumptions under
the bag of words model as well as independence to decide which bucket the article belongs in.

## Next Steps
I might want to build on this further to make it a web app that can scrape text for you and feed it into the model by providing a link 
to a news story!
