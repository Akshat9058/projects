# Introduction
Have you ever wanted to build your own extension for Google Chrome but wasn't sure when to start? We're going to be building a simple extension that saves the text you highlight with your cursor!
## Setting Up Files
Let's get started by talking about all the files we'll need to create and understanding their purpose. In a new folder, create the following files:

* manifest.json
* popup.html
* popup.js
* background.js
* main.css

Wow, so there are actually a number of files that go into this. We're going to dive into each file's purpose as we go through the project. 

### Getting an Icon
One other file you'll need is an icon. If you want to make your own then check out [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), otherwise download the same icon I created from my repository [here](https://github.com/maximgeller/projects/blob/master/chrome_extension/img/icon48.png?raw=true). Add it to the same folder as the other files.
