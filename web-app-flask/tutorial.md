# Introduction
Web development in...*Python*??? Yup, it's true. In this project, we'll be making our very own web app using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) micro-framework and deploying it via the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)! By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to make your own web apps using Python and Flask and share them with your friends to use.
## Dependencies
If you've touched Python and HTML/CSS before, this tutorial is for you. Also, you'll need a Google account for deploying your app and getting a live URL for it. While this is not necessary, it's a really cool way to share what you've built with your friends.
