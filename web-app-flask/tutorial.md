# Introduction
Web development in...*Python*??? Yup, it's true. In this project, we'll be making our very own web app using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) micro-framework and deploying it via the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)! By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to make your own web apps using Python and Flask and share them with your friends to use.
